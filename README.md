# Warehouse-Robot-Reinforcement-Learning-Project
This project involves designing a custom simulation environment to mimic a warehouse scenario where a robot navigates a grid to pick up and deliver items efficiently. The robot is trained using Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to develop optimal strategies for warehouse tasks.
